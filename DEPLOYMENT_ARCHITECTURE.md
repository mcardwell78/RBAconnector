# DC Power Connector - Development & Deployment Architecture

## Current Setup Overview

### 🏠 **Local Development Environment**
- **Location:** `c:\Users\micha\OneDrive\Desktop\Personal Docs\Hobby Work\DC Power Connector`
- **Purpose:** Development and testing
- **How to run:** `npm start` (runs on `http://localhost:3000`)
- **Status:** ✅ Working locally

### 🔄 **GitHub Repository** 
- **Purpose:** Code version control and backup
- **Status:** ❓ **UNKNOWN** - Need to check if this exists
- **Commands:** `git push`, `git pull`, etc.

### ☁️ **Firebase Hosting** (Current Live Site)
- **URL:** Likely something like `https://dc-power-connector.web.app`
- **Purpose:** Current live hosting platform
- **Deploy command:** `firebase deploy`
- **Status:** ✅ Working (we've been deploying here)

### 🌐 **rbaconnector.com Domain** (Your Purchased Domain)
- **Status:** ❓ **NOT CONNECTED YET**
- **Current use:** Only for Zoho email domain verification
- **Future use:** Should host the live application

---

## How Everything Should Connect

```
LOCAL FILES (Your Computer)
    ↓ git push
GITHUB REPOSITORY (Code Storage)
    ↓ deploy
FIREBASE HOSTING (Current Live Site)
    ↓ custom domain
RBACONNECTOR.COM (Your Domain)
```

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ **What's Working:**
1. **Local Development** - `npm start` runs the app locally
2. **Firebase Functions** - Backend APIs are deployed and working
3. **Firebase Hosting** - App is live on Firebase URL
4. **Domain Verification** - `rbaconnector.com` is verified in Zoho

### ❓ **What's Unknown:**
1. **GitHub Repository** - Do we have one? Is it up to date?
2. **Domain Connection** - Is `rbaconnector.com` connected to Firebase?

### ❌ **What's Missing:**
1. **Custom Domain Setup** - `rbaconnector.com` → Firebase Hosting
2. **Proper Git Workflow** - Regular commits and pushes

---

## Let's Check Current Status

### 1. Check if GitHub Repository Exists
```bash
# In your project folder
git remote -v
```

### 2. Check Firebase Hosting Status
```bash
firebase hosting:sites:list
```

### 3. Check Custom Domain Status
```bash
firebase hosting:domains:list
```

---

## Complete Deployment Architecture (Goal)

### **Development Flow:**
1. 🔧 **Code locally** → Test with `npm start`
2. 📝 **Commit changes** → `git add . && git commit -m "message"`
3. ☁️ **Push to GitHub** → `git push origin main`
4. 🚀 **Deploy to Firebase** → `firebase deploy`
5. 🌐 **Live on rbaconnector.com** → Automatic via custom domain

### **User Access:**
- **Developers:** Access via `localhost:3000` during development
- **Testing:** Access via Firebase URL (like `dc-power-connector.web.app`)
- **Production:** Access via `https://rbaconnector.com` (your custom domain)

## Next Steps to Complete Setup

### **IMMEDIATE - Check Current State:**
1. ✅ Verify GitHub repository status
2. ✅ Check Firebase hosting domains
3. ✅ Confirm where the app is currently live

### **SETUP - Connect Your Domain:**
1. 🌐 Connect `rbaconnector.com` to Firebase Hosting
2. 🔒 Setup SSL certificate for HTTPS
3. 🔄 Test the full flow

### **WORKFLOW - Establish Process:**
1. 📝 Setup regular Git commits
2. 🚀 Establish deployment process
3. 📊 Monitor live site

## Questions to Resolve:

1. **Do you have a GitHub repository for this project?**
2. **What's the current Firebase hosting URL where the app is live?**
3. **Do you want to connect rbaconnector.com to host the app?**
4. **Are you regularly committing changes to Git?**

Let me help you check these and get everything properly connected!
